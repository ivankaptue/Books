# Books android application. This application will help user find books on [Google Books](https://books.google.com/).
You can then imagine that it use the google book API.
This project is an application of Simone Alessandria course [Building Your First Connected App with Android Studio](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/android-studio-connected-app-building-first/table-of-contents) from pluralsight.
I plan to add more features later :)
